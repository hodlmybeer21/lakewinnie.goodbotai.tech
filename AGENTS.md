## TL;DR

A single-file static web app (`index.html`, ~165 KB) that gives Winnipesaukee boaters a Garmin-HUD-style map with live GPS, crowdsourced buoys/hazards, NH GRANIT bathymetry (low-confidence reference), marina & fuel-dock locator, bridges & clearance (off by default), shipped recommended routes (cached locally from `data/winni-routes.json`), a "Where am I" rescue helper, and GPS trip logging with GPX export. No backend. Auto-deploys to Vercel on push to `main`.

## What the app does (built 2026-07-05)

1. **Live GPS** — speed (kn), heading (°), compass rose, accuracy circle.
2. **Public boat launches** — 18+ NH launches with fees/notes, hardcoded `LAUNCHES` array in index.html.
3. **Islands** — hardcoded `ISLANDS` polygon array, gray fill.
4. **Crowdsourced buoys** — `localStorage.winniBuoys`. 4 types: red, green, white, yellow.
5. **Crowdsourced hazards** — `localStorage.winniHazards`. 5 types: rock, submerged, shallow, current, other. Red triangle markers.
6. **Crowdsourced depth soundings** — `localStorage.winniDepths`. **DORMANT in current prod** (modal button + layer checkbox removed in commit `4b9a260` but the helpers + storage are still in the code, ready to re-enable). See "Toggling depths on/off" below.
7. **NH GRANIT bathymetry** — `layers.bathyLines` + `layers.bathyBands`. Off by default. Loads from `nhgeodata.unh.edu` and `granit24a.sr.unh.edu` (CORS-friendly for the deployed origin). Cached in localStorage with 30-day TTL. Yellow disclaimer banner shown while layer is on; every popup repeats "NOT for navigation — verify on an authoritative cruising chart."
8. **Trip logging** — `localStorage.winniTrips`. Every GPS run auto-records a teal dotted trail behind the boat, throttled to ~3s or 5m of movement. On Stop GPS, prompts to name the trip. Past trips exportable as GPX.
9. **Bridges & clearance** — `layers.bridges` + `BRIDGES` array. Off by default (per AGENTS.md rule #1). Rotated-diamond icon with a red "low clearance" bar on top, suggesting respect for vertical clearance. Each popup carries a `source` citation, the typical clearance in feet, **and a live clearance calculator** that uses the standard full-lake reference formula (`chart_clearance + 4.3 - lake_level`). Lake level is fetched from USGS 01080000 on boot (graceful fallback if offline), cached in `localStorage.winniLakeLevel`, with a manual override input always available in the popup.

   Two categories of crossings live in `BRIDGES[]`:

   - **Public roadway bridges** (Wolfeboro Bay truss, Lakeport Draw) — verifiable clearance from NH DOT inventory or `LAUNCHES[]` notes.
   - **Bridged-island private/association bridges** (Long Island, Black Cat Island, Governor's Island, Oak Island, Worcester Island, Christmas/Plummers Island, Birch–Steamboat "Rainbow Bridge") — Lake Winnipesaukee has ~6 famous bridged islands where boats pass UNDER private bridges. Most clearances are NOT publicly published. These ship with `clearance_ft: null` and a yellow "⚠ Clearance unverified" banner in the popup; the live clearance calculator is hidden for them. Coordinates are derived from nearby island-property addresses and flagged via `coords_note` ("Approximate — verify on chart before relying").

   Future expansion: add published page references to upgrade bridged-island entries from `null` clearance to verified numbers, and replace approximate coords with verified locations when available. Never ship an entry with an empty `source` field.
10. **🆘 Where-am-I rescue helper** — `showRescueModal()`. Tapping the new 🆘 action-bar button opens a modal with the current lat/lng (copyable), nearest public launch via haversine on the `LAUNCHES[]` array, nearest marina via haversine on the `MARINAS[]` array, a pre-formatted SMS-ready message, and one-tap `tel:` links to 911 and NH Marine Patrol (603-293-2037). Falls back to lake center if GPS not acquired, falls back to select-and-copy if the Clipboard API is blocked.
11. **POIs (restaurants / hotels / groceries)** — `layers.pois` + `POI_TYPES` (restaurant / hotel / grocery) + crowdsourced `localStorage.winniPoisV1`. Follows the buoys/hazards CRUD pattern. Seeded on first load from a 2014 restaurants + 2016 hotels reference directory using the nearest `LAUNCHES[]` coords for each entry; seed is one-shot (flag `winniPoisV1Seeded`). User-added POIs carry their own `source` field for verification. v1 seed is 27 entries. Tap 📍 → 🍽 POI to add a new one anywhere on the lake.

## Workflow for adding a new layer (the pattern)

When Tyler asks for a new crowdsourced layer (buoys, hazards, depth soundings all followed this exact pattern):

1. **State + storage** — `storedXxx = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('winniXxx') || '[]')` near the other `storedXxx` declarations.
2. **Layer object** — add `xxx: null` to the `layers` object; initialize with `L.layerGroup()` in `initMap()`; populate from storage.
3. **CRUD block** — `addXxxToLayer`, `saveXxx`, `addXxx`, `deleteXxx` (window-exposed), `rebuildXxxLayer`. Mirror the hazard code; it's the cleanest example.
4. **Type constants** — `XXX_TYPES` object near `BUOY_TYPES`/`HAZARD_TYPES` (color, label).
5. **Modal flow** — if it goes through the 📍 modal, add a button to `showAddChoiceModal`'s actions row, a `showXxxModal()` function, and a `confirmXxx()` handler.
6. **Layer toggle** — add `<label class="layer-toggle">` to the layer panel and a `change` listener in `wireUI`.
7. **Export** — include in the JSON payload of `exportBtn`.
8. **Info modal** — bump the saved-locally counter.
9. **Marker CSS** — if it needs a custom divIcon, add a class to the `.buoy-marker` / `.hazard-marker` / `.depth-marker` block in the `<style>` section.

## Critical rules — do not violate

These were all hard-won. Don't re-make any of these mistakes.

1. **NEVER add hardcoded geographic data unless it comes from a named, authoritative source AND is clearly labeled "low-confidence reference".** Tyler has removed four such layers over the course of building this app because they were inaccurate:
   - Duck-shaped lake outline polygon (commit `1b5f7c1`)
   - NH GRANIT shoreline overlay (commit `e0a0a39`)
   - No-wake zones (50 polygons, commit `8317396`)
   - Static hazards (Three Broads / Rocky Shoal / Five-Finger Point, commit `4b9a260`'s parent)

   **If a data source isn't authoritative for navigation, it goes behind a toggle that's off by default with a permanent in-app disclaimer.** NH GRANIT bathymetry is the only acceptable exception, and only because the NHDES license explicitly says "SHOULD NOT be used for navigational purposes" — we surface that exact wording.

2. **Always defer to a printed cruising chart for navigation.** The app's persistent tagline: "Recreation aid — not for primary navigation."

3. **JS parse check before commit.** After editing `index.html`, run:
   ```bash
   node -e "const html=require('fs').readFileSync('index.html','utf8');const m=html.match(/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g);const code=m[m.length-1].replace(/^<script>/,'').replace(/<\/script>$/,'');try{new Function(code);console.log('JS OK,',code.length,'bytes')}catch(e){console.log('ERR:',e.message)}"
   ```
   Must print `JS OK, ...`. If it prints `ERR: ...`, do not push.

4. **Vercel can take a moment to redeploy after a force-push.** If `git reset --hard <old-sha> && git push --force-with-lease` doesn't appear to redeploy, do a no-op empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-trigger Vercel deploy"`) and push. Also check `x-vercel-cache: MISS` and `age: 0` on a cache-busted `curl` to confirm fresh deploy.

5. **NH GRANIT endpoints require the deployed origin for CORS.** They `vary: Origin` and `access-control-allow-origin` returns the request origin. If Tyler ever changes the deploy URL, the bathymetry fetch will fail with a CORS error. CORS test:
   ```bash
   curl -sI -H 'Origin: https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech' \
     'https://nhgeodata.unh.edu/hosting/rest/services/Hosted/EDP_Bathymetry_Lakes/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&f=json&returnCountOnly=true'
   ```
   Should return HTTP 200 with `access-control-allow-origin: https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech`.

## Toggling depths on/off

The depth soundings UI (modal button + layer toggle) was removed in commit `4b9a260` per Tyler's request, but the underlying machinery stayed in place:

- `layers.depths` layer group — initialized in `initMap`, populated from `storedDepths`
- `HAZARD_TYPES`-style depth marker icon (`depthColor`, `depthIcon`, `.depth-marker` CSS)
- CRUD: `addDepthToLayer`, `addDepth`, `deleteDepth`, `rebuildDepthLayer`
- `showDepthModal`, `confirmDepth` modal flow
- Export includes `depths` array

To re-enable the UI: add `<button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="showDepthModal()">📏 Depth</button>` to `showAddChoiceModal`'s actions, and `<label class="layer-toggle"><input type="checkbox" id="layerDepths" /> Depth soundings (yours)</label>` to the layer panel. Also re-attach the `layerDepths` change listener and the `confirmDepth` "make layer visible" code in the save handler.

## Working with Vercel + the force-push gotcha

This has bitten us once. If you need to roll back to an earlier commit:

```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/winni-map
git reset --hard <old-sha>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
# Then verify Vercel picked it up:
curl -sI "https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech/?cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -i age
# Should show 'age: 0' and 'x-vercel-cache: MISS'.
# If not, do an empty commit to wake Vercel up:
git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-trigger Vercel deploy"
git push origin main
```

## Useful commands

```bash
# Validate JS in index.html
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/winni-map
node -e "const html=require('fs').readFileSync('index.html','utf8');const m=html.match(/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g);const code=m[m.length-1].replace(/^<script>/,'').replace(/<\/script>$/,'');try{new Function(code);console.log('JS OK,',code.length,'bytes')}catch(e){console.log('ERR:',e.message)}"

# Verify live deploy is fresh + serves new code
curl -sI "https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech/?cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -iE "age|x-vercel-cache"
curl -s  "https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech/?cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -c "loadNHGranitBathy"

# Test NH GRANIT CORS
curl -sI -H 'Origin: https://lakewinni.goodbotai.tech' \
  'https://nhgeodata.unh.edu/hosting/rest/services/Hosted/EDP_Bathymetry_Lakes/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&f=json&returnCountOnly=true'

# Check git state
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/winni-map && git status --short && git log --oneline -5
```

## Open items / pending decisions

- **VT double-post cron fix** — Tyler hasn't given go-ahead.
- **No-wake zones** — removed 2026-07-05 (was inaccurate). Could come back as crowdsourced like buoys/hazards if Tyler wants them, but not requested yet.
- **Lake shoreline overlay** — removed 2026-07-05. Same: could be crowdsourced if Tyler wants it back.
- **Duck-shaped lake outline** — removed. Permanent dead. Don't recreate it.
- **Depth soundings UI** — currently dormant. Re-enable on request.

## Known gotchas that will bite you

1. **`haversine()` is used by trip append logic and called from `onPos()` at runtime, but declared AFTER `onPos()` in source order.** It works because it's a function declaration (hoists). Don't refactor it to a `const = () =>` arrow or it'll break.

2. **`appendTripPoint` is called from `onPos`, which is invoked by the GPS watcher.** Same hoisting rule applies to any helper called from `onPos`.

3. **Layers panel is collapsed by default with header/body split.** The DOM has `<div id="layers" class="hud collapsed">` containing `#layers-header` (the chip) and `#layers-body` (the body of checkboxes). The state is persisted in `localStorage.winniLayersOpen` (`'1'` / `'0'`); default-on-first-visit is collapsed. If you add a new layer checkbox, append it inside `#layers-body`, never outside — the chip-side header is click-only. Outside-tap close and Escape close are global listeners on `document`; if you add a new modal-style overlay that lives outside `#layers`, make sure it suppresses propagation on its own click or the panel will close mid-interaction.

4. **Leaflet `setRotationAngle`** is used for the user marker heading. It's a `leaflet-rotatedmarker`-style API; if you swap Leaflet versions, this might break. Pin Leaflet to 1.9.4 (already pinned via CDN).

4. **`modal` CSS class** — adding `.show` shows it; removing hides. The depth-soundings modal prompt reuses the same modal element. Don't introduce a second modal.

5. **`onMapClick` only fires when `buoyAddMode === true`**, which is the 📍-button-toggled mode. So adding a non-buoy layer through a different button (e.g. an "add hazard here" map-click) requires entering buoy-add mode first, or refactoring.

6. **Trip popup's "View" button calls `viewTripOnMap(id)` which fits bounds and dismisses the modal.** If you add more layers to trips (e.g. waypoints), the bounds-fit logic may need updating.

7. **The Trips layer uses `lineCap: 'round'` + `dashArray: '6, 6'`** for the dotted-line aesthetic. Don't change to solid.

8. **localStorage quota is ~5 MB per origin.** NH GRANIT bathymetry GeoJSON is ~10 MB total, so we cache lines (3.7 MB) and bands (6.5 MB) separately in localStorage. If the quota is exceeded the cache write fails silently and re-fetches next session.

9. **Shipped recommended routes (`data/winni-routes.json`) are SEPARATE from user finger-drawn routes.** Two storage keys, two layer functions, two modal functions:
   - `winniRoutes` + `addRouteToLayer` + `openRouteActionsModal` = user finger-drawn (blue dashed, editable, deletable)
   - `winniShippedRoutesV1` + `addShippedRouteToLayer` + `openShippedRouteModal` = shipped recommendations (orange solid, NOT editable, GPX-exportable, "Route to start" via Google Maps)
   - Both render into the SAME `layers.routes` group and share the same `#layerRoutes` toggle. Don't split them into two toggles — the visual distinction (orange solid vs blue dashed) is enough.
   - The shipped file is fetched on boot (`seedShippedRoutesIfNeeded`), cached with version flag `winniShippedRoutesSeedV1` matching `SHIPPED_ROUTES_VERSION`. Bump the version constant when the file shape changes (e.g. new required fields).
   - The seed has no inline fallback (unlike buoys) because routes are hand-authored and a stale cache is better than a blank layer. On fetch failure, the cache renders and the version flag is NOT updated, so next visit retries.
   - `computeRouteDistanceNm()` and `escapeHtml()` are hoisted function declarations shared by the modal + GPX export. Don't arrowify them — `openShippedRouteModal` is called from a Leaflet click handler that may execute before all `const` arrow initializers in the file have run.

10. **All data layers start OFF on first visit EXCEPT Routes (as of 2026-07-10).** Tyler wants first-time visitors to experience the layers one at a time — except for the Routes layer, which ships ON by default because the shipped recommended routes are the marquee feature and should be visible immediately. Don't re-add `checked` attributes to layer checkboxes or `.addTo(map)` calls in `initMap()` for the other layers. Programmatic `checked = true` + `addTo(map)` IS allowed in user-triggered paths (saving a buoy, viewing a trip, entering route-draw mode, etc.) — the rule is only about the initial empty-map state. If you add a new layer, default it OFF unless Tyler says otherwise. At boot: base map (OSM tiles) + island orientation polygons + Routes layer (with shipped recommendations) are all visible; the other 9 layers render only when toggled.

## Contact

If you break something, Tyler prefers you:
1. Fix it directly if the fix is obvious
2. Otherwise, ask before making a destructive change (especially anything that touches `localStorage` keys or removes geographic data)
